1. Objective
To design and implement a Bash scripting suite in Linux that automates key system
maintenance tasks such as performing backups, updates, and log monitoring to enhance
system reliability and reduce manual effort.

2. Introduction
Linux provides a powerful command-line environment that supports Bash scripting for
automating administrative tasks. This assignment focuses on creating a single
menu-driven script that integrates multiple maintenance functions like backup, update, and
log monitoring.

3. Concept and Tools Used
Tools used include Bash for scripting, tar for backups, apt for system updates, grep for log
monitoring, and simple text-based menus for user interaction.

4. Script Design
The script combines three major functionalities: (a) Automated backups, (b) System
update & cleanup, and (c) Log monitoring. It features colored output, logging, and robust
error handling.

5. Results and Observations
Task Description Status
Backup Created compressed archives with logs n Successful
Update Executed system update and cleanup n Completed
Log Monitoring Filtered and displayed live system logs n Working

6. Advantages
Automates repetitive administrative tasks efficiently. Ensures regular backups and system
reliability. Reduces human error through scripting. Provides log monitoring for quick
troubleshooting. Improves productivity and system performance.

7. Conclusion
The System Maintenance Suite effectively automates essential Linux maintenance
operations, providing a reliable and user-friendly way to manage backups, updates, and
logs. It demonstrates practical system administration skills and reflects the importance of
scripting in real-world IT operations.
